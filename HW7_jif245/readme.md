The authorea paper was done in conjunction with Juan Sokoloff. 
We tested the hypothesys and address both our reviewers in the paper.
Juan did additional analyses with the unkown group that we discussed in the paper but I did not include in my notebook.
I suggested the simulations with smaller sample size to have an idea of the effect of the size in the statistical analysis.
