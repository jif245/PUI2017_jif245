### a. verify that their Null and alternative hypotheses are formulated correctly

From what I understand, his hypothesis is that tourists/customers use bikes for longer periods of time than 
regular users. The "higher" amount of time is represented by the limit of 700 s. 
The Null Hypothesis is correctly expresed in the sentence. The ratio of people riding for more than 700 should be higher in the  regular users than in tourists (Ho). This is what we want to disprove.

In the mathematical formulation I think it looks like it's reversed. The formula doesn't render correctly, and after reloading the markdown code, it looks like is inverted.

### b. verify that the data supports the project

The data was correctly wrangled. He constructed a table with the amounts of people in each group leaving the 
information properly formatted for performing the following test. 

### c. chose an appropriate test to test H0 given the type of data, and the question asked. 

I think the most appropiate test would be a Chi-Square. We need to test if the distribution of people differs between two categories.
A Chi-squeare would fit the purpose and is not complex nor it needs the data to be paramatric.

### Observations

I like the hypothesis and the idea. The information from the results could guide some other type of pricing model (exploit the tourists, yeah!). It is also interesting that the great majority of the regular commuters use the service for less than 12 minutes. 

As a complement of the above analysis I would try to for differences between the tourists that buy a 3 and a 1 day pass. Also, I would to try to look how this difference between tourist and regular commuters varies along the year (in seasons with more tuorisms) and in weekdays/weekends. 
Extending on this, if a particular month has a different ratio that could be optimized, a different pricing could be applied to motivate the use of the citibike service for tourists...in the freezing weather, or the like.
