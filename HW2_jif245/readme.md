## HomeWork 2
Part 1 and 2 of this work was done in conjunction with Juan Sokoloff (jss895). Both collaborated in finding the variables and writing the code to print and write the information of the bus lines. 

The work was done mainly locally by downloading a json file and working in jupyter notebooks until getting the code right.

Notes:
Jack Lundquist provided help with the json file visualization and for the syntax in how to get information from the command line for the correct execution of the python script. 
Dana Chermesh provided help with the writing to the csv file. Although we end up using a pandas dataframe for the final version.

Part 3 was also done with help of Juan Sokoloff and Jack Lundquist, who helped set up the environmental variable (I wasn't using the correct Kernel). Also Juan help reference the address of the datasets in the CUSP data hub.

The extra points section was done with help of Jack Lundquist, who suggested setting the limits of the graph so as to not show the outliers in the graph.
