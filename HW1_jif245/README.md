# PUI2017_jif245
This is a file I modified locally with emacs for Homework 2.

First I added an alias to the bash file in linux, like so:

![Alt text](HW2_jif245/setting_alias.png)

This alias (pui2017) makes it easier to access the git folder that I'm going to use.

After that, I close the terminal and open it again to check the bash file was correctly configured with the alias:

![Alt text](HW2_jif245/bash_screen.png)

Note: I had to uploaded like three times. First I changed the names of the files because I had "jpg" images with spaces in their names (e.g. "bash screen") and I was having problems to make the rmd load them.
After I fix that I noted that the screenshots were inverted, so I had to change the README.md file once again.
This is the third time I uploaded, hope it works.
