## Review of jif245's Visualization Plot

### Review

This plot as described by Julian tells us about the number of crimes through each borough from 2000-2016. The gives me all the information I need to know as the points represent each year and the dip and rise gives me the count of the crime committed in that year. The legend is properly placed and the colours used for each borough are distinguishable.

According to Julian, this plot gives us the ratio of crimes committed in each borough each year to number of crimes committed in each borough in 2010. What strikes me about this plot is, if the ratio represents number of crime committed per year to crimes committed in 2010, then the ratio for 2010 should've been 1.0 and some other decimal value for the year 2000. From the plot I can decipher that the ratio is compared to crimes committed in 2000 and not 2010, therefore the title and ylabel does not describe the data properly.

### Suggestion

The choice of plot is apt with the kind of data used. I would just be more careful about the labels and titles I'm using for the plots as it creates confusion.
