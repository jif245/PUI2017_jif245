The null and alternative hypothesis are formulated correctly.

The data was properly formatted, as Julian is trying to find if trip duration varies significantly by gender, and he 
created a dataframe that includes both trip duration and gender.

A z-test can be used to test the null hypothesis. A z-test will be able to determine the difference between two population 
means (the two genders in the dataset) by testing one continuous dependent variable (trip duration). A t-test would be less 
accurate as it is used for fewer inputs by comparing sample means.
