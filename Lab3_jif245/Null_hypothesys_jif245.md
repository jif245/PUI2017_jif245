### Formulate the Null hypothesis in words and in formulae for the 4 experiments below:

**Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise?**

Experimental setup: you have a test and a control sample.

##Hypothesis

**Null Hypothesis (H0): Fat loss by diet is significantly the same or less than fat loss by excercise. (percentage of fat loss)
**Alternative Hypothesis (H1): Fat loss by diet is significantly more than fat loss by excercise.

Ho: E>=D
Ho: E< D

**Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women.** (Olds et al., 1994, p. 223)

Experimemtal setup: measure IQ of children at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 years of age.


Hypothesis: Kids from mothers who have smoked during pregnancy have lower IQ.

**Null Hypothesis (H0): 
**Alternative Hypothesis (H1): Children from ages 1 to 4 bornd from mothers who smoked during pregnancy have IQ significantly lower than those whose mothers have not smoked.  



**Contribute to the incidence of diabetes** 
Food deserts are defined as parts of the country vapid of fresh fruit, vegetables, and other healthful whole foods, usually found in impoverished areas. This is largely due to a lack of grocery stores, farmers' markets, and healthy food providers.

This is not a lab experiment, but you have data the incidence of diabetes for the US population.
